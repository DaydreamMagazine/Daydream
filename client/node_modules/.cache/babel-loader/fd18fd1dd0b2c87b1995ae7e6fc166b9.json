That was just probably our first formal introduction to each other. I think the start of our friendship was that following summer, when that first point of connection in the Spring was just a way to have a sort of “ally” in this other class that we were taking. And so we reached out to each other, and started to study and then became really good friends over time.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <img class=\".image-container\" src={'chapter-1.jpg'} width={400} height={600}></img>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"content-white\">\n                <img class=\".image-container\" src={'chapter-2.jpg'} width={580.4} height={395.9}></img>\n                <div className=\"qa\">\n                    <p><b>\n                        Q: How did the idea for DayDream Magazine begin? \n                    </b></p>\n                    <br/>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>MICHELLE:</b> The very first conversation that we ever had about DayDream was actually after this huge event at UF called Health Career Showcase. I believe it was in February 2020, which is the month before everything officially shut down … At that time, I had been debating and thinking about this concept of having something and creating something that was going to be left behind at UF that was gonna fulfill some of the niches that I had seen as being unfulfilled during that time in my undergraduate career.\n                    </p>\n                    <br/>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>HANNAH:</b> It was really just a conversation to pass time while we waited for friends to meet up with us. But back in December 2019, I was with some other friends, and they kind of told me about an experience that they had with another  publication. It just really showed how there's a lot of awareness for the need for diversity in these different platforms, but the approach is very different. It can often just lead to tokenization. … That just sat really unwell with me. With that group of friends, we had, like, a three-hour conversation in the middle of the day. … I wanted to somehow help, to create a platform that is actually, at its core, designed for people who don't necessarily have a place to express themselves. And in no way was I envisioning a magazine. I think that was a lot of Michelle's artistic passion really coming out. \n                    </p>\n                    <br/>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>MICHELLE:</b> It took, I think, many more conversations about figuring out the name, doing the groundwork and frameworking things over the course of the next few months … But I think that it was just a meeting of minds at a moment where it made sense. \n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"content-white\">\n                <div className=\"qa\">\n                    <p><b>\n                        Q: Where did the five themes from this issue come from?  \n                    </b></p>\n                    <br/>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>HANNAH:</b> The reason why we came into even creating this was to make sure that there is a space for every type of life that’s lived to be expressed.

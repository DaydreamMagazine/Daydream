It was back when things were lively and normal, and we were both in the spring semester of our sophomore year. I was sitting at one of the tables, and I was actually — I wouldn't say complaining, I was cathartically talking about an experience that I had recently that was stressful with one of the organizations that I was in. And Hannah happened to be in that same organization. She overheard my conversation and introduced herself. \n                    </p>\n                    <br/>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>HANNAH:</b> I didn't know Michelle before. Even though we had pretty much taken the same classes, we had never crossed paths … But I think that wasn't really the start of our friendship, necessarily. That was just probably our first formal introduction to each other. I think the start of our friendship was that following summer, when that first point of connection in the Spring was just a way to have a sort of “ally” in this other class that we were taking. And so we reached out to each other, and started to study and then became really good friends over time.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <img class=\".image-container\" src={'chapter-1.jpg'} width={300} height={450}></img>\n            </div>\n\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n\n            <div className=\"content-white-column\">\n                <p><b>\n                    Q: How did the idea for DayDream Magazine begin? \n                </b></p>\n                <br/>\n                <p>\n                    <b>MICHELLE:</b> The very first conversation that we ever had about DayDream was actually after this huge event at UF called Health Career Showcase. I believe it was in February 2020, which is the month before everything officially shut down … At that time, I had been debating and thinking about this concept of having something and creating something that was going to be left behind at UF that was gonna fulfill some of the niches that I had seen as being unfulfilled during that time in my undergraduate career.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n\n            <div className=\"content-white\">\n                <img class=\".image-container\" src={'chapter-2.jpg'} width={773.9} height={527.9}></img>\n            </div>\n\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n\n            <div className=\"content-white-column\">\n                <p>\n                    <b>HANNAH:</b> It was really just a conversation to pass time while we waited for friends to meet up with us. But back in December 2019, I was with some other friends, and they kind of told me about an experience that they had with another  publication. It just really showed how there's a lot of awareness for the need for diversity in these different platforms, but the approach is very different. It can often just lead to tokenization. … That just sat really unwell with me. With that group of friends, we had, like, a three-hour conversation in the middle of the day. … I wanted to somehow help, to create a platform that is actually, at its core, designed for people who don't necessarily have a place to express themselves. And in no way was I envisioning a magazine. I think that was a lot of Michelle's artistic passion really coming out. \n                </p>\n                <br/>\n                <p>\n                    <b>MICHELLE:</b> It took, I think, many more conversations about figuring out the name, doing the groundwork and frameworking things over the course of the next few months … But I think that it was just a meeting of minds at a moment where it made sense. \n                </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n\n            <div className=\"content-white\">\n                <div className=\"qa\">\n                    <p><b>\n                        Q: Where did the five themes from this issue come from?  \n                    </b></p>\n                    <br/>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>HANNAH:</b> The reason why we came into even creating this was to make sure that there is a space for every type of life that’s lived to be expressed. We wanted to make sure that whatever we were including was something that's experienced by everybody in the entire world, regardless of any sort of identity, but is expressed differently because of those different identities that we bring to the table. So when we went through and came up with the five different chapters, we wanted to come up with things that are universal in its existence, but just manifest differently. \n                    </p>\n                    <br/>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>MICHELLE:</b> Recently, there's been a whole societal push towards unlearning and relearning. Looking at these concepts that we've known to be true for so long, and rediscovering them for the truth of what they are. I'm sure that's a continual process. I hope that is going to continue into the future indefinitely. And so I think also that these chapters, because they're universal things that are experienced in everyone's life, are an opportunity for us to help contribute to that [unlearning and learning] as well. \n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <img class=\".image-container\" src={'chapter-3.jpg'} width={355.5} height={506.7}></img>\n            </div>\n\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>         \n\n            <div className=\"content-white\">\n                <img class=\".image-container\" src={'chapter-4.jpg'} width={400} height={600}></img>\n                <div className=\"qa\">\n                    <p><b>\n                        Q: The entire production of this magazine was virtual.

That's probably been one of the most important factors to the success of this magazine. It would not be possible without  very strong, constant, and effective communication. I also think that there's a lot of passion behind a lot of our team members. …  I'll say also, though, it was extremely hard. I will not romanticize the process. It was extremely difficult.

I tell Hannah all the time — sometimes I look at the things that we've done in the past year, and I say, “I cannot believe what our team was able to execute. I literally cannot believe this happened.” It seems so fictional.

That feeling is just so fulfilling in a way that I cannot even express. …  [I wish] I could preserve it and bottle it up and reference it whenever I was at a low point. It has just been the largest motivator, I think, throughout this entire production.

At every level, the ways in which we've been able to incorporate different community members, or different community organizations, or different businesses, all of that has been so impactful. Because I think that at the end of the day, we didn't just want to make it a UF-based publication, though we are both students.

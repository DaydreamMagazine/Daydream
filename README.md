# Daydream
SWE Project: 
We will create a website for the DayDream Magazine at UF. This website will have an "About Us" tab, information on the magazine contributers, a merchandise store, a link to their social media, a link to their magazine, etc....
Our current plan is to use the MERN stack to implement this project.
